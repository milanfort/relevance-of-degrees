# Relevance of Degrees


## Introduction

This repository contains our final project for the
[Data Analysis and Statistical Inference](https://www.coursera.org/course/statistics)
online course from Duke University on Coursera.

The task was to analyze the provided
[General Social Survey](http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR34802.v1) dataset,
formulate a research question that can be answered using these data,
and answer this question utilizing the appropriate statistical inference method.


## Solution

After analyzing the data, we decided to use it to answer the following research question:

**Does academic degree affect the chance of getting a full-time job?**

We used the *Chi-Square Test for Independence* in our analysis.
Full report that documents the analysis and interprets the result in context of the data
and the research question can be found at
